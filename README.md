# About

This repository serves as a personal resource for accessing my dotfiles on university computers. Please note that I do not actively maintain or regularly update it. 

For now, it looks a lot like the default [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration (because it is ðŸ˜¬).
